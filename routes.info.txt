/*Routes needed for the LocalLibrary*/

The URLs that we're ultimately going to need for our pages are listed below,
where object is replaced by the name of each of our models (book, bookinstance, genre, author),
objects is the plural of object,
and id is the unique instance field (_id) that is given to each Mongoose model instance by default.

catalog/ — The home/index page.
catalog/<objects>/ — The list of all books, bookinstances, genres, or authors (e.g. /catalog/books/, /catalog/genres/, etc.)
catalog/<object>/<id> — The detail page for a specific book, bookinstance, genre, or author with the given _id field value (e.g. /catalog/book/584493c1f4887f06c0e67d37).
catalog/<object>/create — The form to create a new book, bookinstance, genre, or author (e.g. /catalog/book/create).
catalog/<object>/<id>/update — The form to update a specific book, bookinstance, genre, or author with the given _id field value (e.g. /catalog/book/584493c1f4887f06c0e67d37/update).
catalog/<object>/<id>/delete — The form to delete a specific book, bookinstance, genre, author with the given _id field value (e.g. /catalog/book/584493c1f4887f06c0e67d37/delete).
